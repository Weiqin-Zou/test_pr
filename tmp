I commit yes!
commit again by zouxiaoyu after zouweiqin's pr
can i commit again without merge pr pull?

now，I create a branch from the server。but I have no local branch。
can git pull fetch the branch to the local and create a branch？
we can we up!
fetch will fetch all branches's data?
seems no fetch branchXXX cmd but git fetch origin
