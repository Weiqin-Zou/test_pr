#1 用weiqinzou帐号先fork。
#2 在本地上用git clone克隆下来
   git clone git@github.com:weiqinzou/test_pr.git
#3 多做几次commit
#4 多做几次pr
#use commit log to close an issue
change one line in the master branch for pull

#this time, I want to know if a commit is unique to a branch which is not the main branch. 
will it appear in the repo's commits list if once we use the github api to retrieve a repo's commits?
